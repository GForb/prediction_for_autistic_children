# Prediction for autistic chilren 

This is the github repository for the Prediction for autistic children project. Find more information on our [study page](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/predictions-of-outcomes-for-autistic-children)

The aim of the project is to develop statsitical models that describe the uncertainty of outcomes based on an autistic child's individual characteristics.

We are bringing together data from multiple longitudinal studies of autistic children and will develop prediction models using an individual participant data meta-analysis.


The code is currently under developmet.
